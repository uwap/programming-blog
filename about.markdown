This is my blog about computer science and programming.  
I myself am a computer science student from Germany who is
mainly interested in functional programming and mathmatical modelling
of datastructures and programs as well as writing formal specifications
using mathmatical tools like algebras and program verifications using type
systems, especially dependent types.  
Though these topics are quite interesting to me, this blog is not limited
to those, as I will probably write something about other topics like science,
life and philosophy as well.
